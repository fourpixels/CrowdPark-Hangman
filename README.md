Hangman for Crowdpark


I didn't understand if you want me to load the resources externally or not (because sounds were unable to import),
so I did a basic resource manager that loads everything externally. I've used only the files you've provided me,
and I did all other graphics inside Flash IDE. Hoping that's what you wanted :)

I've placed comments in some places in the code and I hope it's readable enough.

I wasn't able to do all the disposal but I think that I have done the structure and the idea is clear.
The game itself is never disposed anyway ;)

Greetings!
